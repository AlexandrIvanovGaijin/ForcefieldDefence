What you need to know:

LMB: place forcefield tower

RMB: place energy generator

Shields may protect you agains almost any enemy

You can place new structure around generators only(blue zone)!

Enemy can target generators only, but may hit forcefield towers accidently. Keep this in mind when expanding infrastructure.


There is few dangerous types of the enemy. Try to spread your infrastructure or place alot of forcefild for using it as energy storage.
